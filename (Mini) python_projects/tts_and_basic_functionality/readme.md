## How to use

**tts** - select a language, write a text and it will appear as an audio file in the same dir.
**conjugator** - select a language, then write a verb to see it's conjugations.
> (!) Note: verbs should be real, but can also be artificial if their endings are proper. For example, in Portuguese verbs end in -ar -er -ir.
> so, u can think of a new verb, "cobrapular", for example, and it will get conjugated as if it was real.
