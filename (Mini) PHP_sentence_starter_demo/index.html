            <strong>Welcome to the Sentence Translation Challenge!</strong> <br><br>
            In this challenge, you will be given a sentence starter and five example sentences in Russian to practice using it.<br><br>
            Your task is to translate the sentences into English as quickly as possible.<br><br>
            The main focus of this challenge is on speed more than accuracy, so a quantitative approach is more valuable than a qualitative one.<br><br>
            Let's get started and see how fast and accurate you can be in translating these sentences.<br><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;">Good luck!</span><br>
